# Question:
# Define a function which can compute the sum of two numbers.
#
# Hints:
# Define a function with two numbers as arguments. You can compute the sum in the function and return the value.

# Attempt


def sumTwoNum(a, b):
    return a + b


print(sumTwoNum(1, 2))

# Solution:
# def SumFunction(number1, number2):
# 	return number1+number2
#
# print SumFunction(1,2)

# Notes: This was very easy.
